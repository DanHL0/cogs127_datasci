      "i love figma on desktop but the mobile app on phone and ipad fall short in a big way.  i use it almost exclusively for the mirror function and i would have given it 3 stars if it weren’t so buggy.    bugs i have found while using mirror include: - loses connection periodically  - freezes often and needs to be restarted  - the prototype doesn’t always appear exactly as on screen.  for example, i had an icon with a transparent container around it and layers that had shadows.  it looked fine on the computer screen but on the phone, the container background appeared white and the shadows were applied to the container instead of the objects inside it.  - it would be nice to have an option to turn on/off status bar and home bar if they are already on your designs.   - animations are not very smooth.   aside from the mirror feature, i wanted to view and respond to a comment while i was on the go, but i can’t see the comments.    it seems all that i can do view my frames. i would really love editing capabilities, especially for ipad.  if i could design in figma on ipad it would save my hand so much from all the mouse clicks.  in the meantime, i’m just trying to learn all the shortcuts keys!\n",
      "\n",
      "i’m so shocked by how buggy this app is that i have to write a review. mobile designers rely on the mirror function heavily, but it is barely usable, the toast at the bottom never dismisses, it loads slowly and often disconnects, or loads the wrong page and you have to deselect and reselect the frame on computer to trigger the refresh, it ignores your frame selection if u have a flow on this page and will just keep playing that flow… i have no idea who made and approved this, and i’m just simply afraid to touch the open file feature. also no real ipad apps in 2022. hello??\n",
      "\n",
      "i’ve never been more upset with an app. why does my apple pencil work perfectly on other apps, but this one is so buggy. sometimes it will let me drag a shape with the pencil, then it will completely ignore the pencil as if it doesn’t exist. then it will not let me type into the shape or sticky. even the pen tool doesn’t work, it just makes a bunch of random marks?!? the most infuriating. would have been better for this app to not exist than bring my hopes up about working on my ipad.\n",
      "\n",
      "i don’t understand why there is no functionality to edit files in the figma app. i can open figma in a web browser on my ipad and make edits there, but that’s more of a hassle than just being able to use the app. i don’t view prototypes or use figjam as often, so the app is kind of useless as it is now.\n",
      "\n",
      "the fact we can’t edit on the go even on an ipad which is made for working on the go makes this app really useless. i can comment and play prototypes, but if i can’t even do basic things like replacing images or adding text, what’s the point of this but clogging up extra storage on my device?\n",
      "\n",
      "i love figma for desktop (mac) but it needs more improvement for ipad. figjam not only couldn’t save my work, but when i went to another screen and came back, all the work i did for the past 40 minutes was gone! super frustrating.\n",
      "\n",
      "my desktop crashed suddenly so i’m having to finish some projects on my ipad. so far, this has only added to the stress of my situation. i thought having access to figma on my other devices would provide continuity (i’ve never had to use figma on other devices) but clearly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "this review is about how figma works on the ipad pro.   i was totally excited to find out that figma was finally available for the ipad to turn around and notice that it really doesnt do much. :(   i was hoping that they would make use of the pen technology to include sketching or that they even allowed wireframing. sadly its more like a presentation tool on the ipad. :(\n",
      "\n",
      "seriously after this many years still no ipad app? this company makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year but like many companies has taken the path of having a subpar web browser wrapper as a desktop app and a useless ipad app that doesn’t allow editing of projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "nor does it work propoerly on the ipad browsers including safari, chrome, brave and firefox.  the folio case trackpad zoom is not supported in browser. cmd +  mouse wheel scroll does nothing. this app wont allow you to edit files. basically you cannot use figma to design anything on ipad either on the browser or in this app.\n",
      "\n",
      "it really bums me out that figma only lets me actually interact with figjam on my ipad. what i really want is to design from my ipad pro. figma if you’re reading this, please bring the designer to ipados. as it stands, this app isn’t really useful to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "i like the fact that i can use my ipad but when i use my pencil on this app compared to onenote, there is way more latency and i’m not able to use it as cleanly\n",
      "\n",
      "very limited functionality. can’t use stylist let alone create anything with an ipad pro. so much potential if figma team prioritized mobile hardware. currently only good for reviewing and making notes within figjam😭.\n",
      "\n",
      "not sure what’s the point of the ipad app. it’s also very confusing. i can’t edit figma files - only view them?\n",
      "\n",
      "- can’t comment/annotate on m1 ipad pro  - once i hit the preview/play, can’t exit from it - have to kill app - from preview/play, can’t display menu with cmd+\\, even if i enter the combo twice as instructed. - can’t open menu with cmd+\\ from regular page view  unusable\n",
      "\n",
      "we use this ipad for testing at our office with multiple designers who use it. the log out functionality no longer works, so we can’t switch to a new account for testing different projects\n",
      "\n",
      "since there is no way to start a jam from a template on ipad, you need to add templates through the toolbar inside a new view. however if you try this, it soft-locks the application. (noticed with network map diagram)\n",
      "\n",
      "open a prototype on ipad, not sure how to quit. not sure how to enter the preview mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "ipad and phone, it doesn’t let me do anything. shows me a wifi icon and suggests i can log out, but that does nothing as well. i have a bunch projects and designs in my figma account, but absolutely nothing shows here.\n",
      "\n",
      "the figma app on ipad is subpar. you cannot use it very well or intuitively on any device that isn’t desktop. eg buttons will be disabled randomly, you wont be able to view multiple pages in the same file (the button will be disabled). when colleagues invite you to work stations you are redirected to desktop and not the app. overall a very poor experience which has impacted my ability to see the files i need and utilise this properly at work.\n",
      "\n",
      "it’s a shame that the ipad application is limited to viewing only and no editing or productivity features added. for example add post it notes on a board\n",
      "\n",
      "hey guys love the app but it keeps freezing on my ipad m1 latest edition. i have to then close and re open the app which is super frustrating!   please fix this! 🙏🙏🙏\n",
      "\n",
      "i was excited by figjam coming to ipad. but the apple pencil drawing support is dreadful. it’s really laggy and not very responsive. not smooth at all like other ipad apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "i got this app about 2 years ago and it’s been great for quickly evaluating designs on a device. the main problem is that it automatically scales designs to fit the screen, so a design meant for iphone 5 looks ridiculous on an ipad. it’s free, so i can see why it’s not a comprehensive solution for testing on mobile, but in 2 years nothing has really changed. i think it’s been somewhat forgotten about.\n",
      "\n",
      "works well on mobile not on ipad (won’t even open\n",
      "\n",
      "whilst figma’s desktop experience is great their ipad app leaves a lot to be desired. the idea of being able to sketch ideas faster with an apple pencil sounds great until you realise the app has no palm rejection which causes the pencil feedback to be really unresponsive and litters your art board which heaps of dots from your hand as you write/draw.\n",
