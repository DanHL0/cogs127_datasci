1,2022-09-19 15:11:09,"Converted to figma from sketch. Program is a nice upgrade. But one huge design flaw that I can’t get over. When I run my prototype to present, figma loads my assets one by one, it causes an issue because assets should be completely loaded before starting a presentation. Common sense. 

When you first run the presentation let the loader ACTUALLY load the assets then start the presentation. It is embarrassing. What is the point of showing you are loading a prototype if your assets are not actually being loaded.I don’t  want to have to tell my client oh wait for your assets to load. That’s unprofessional. Doesn’t matter if the asset is large or not. Load my assets first before presenting.

This is huge because if I am presenting to a team, they should not see anything in the presentation other than the intended first frame not have the prototype assets load one by one like a website they can click on things before ready. Doesn’t matter if I have large assets or not. When you load a presentation. Load it. Show a spinner. But don’t show the actual assets loading. Automated actions fail to show and overall is not good practice. 

If this is fixed this program will allow me to stop my subscription to my other programs. It’s too embarrassing to load my prototypes to my clients right now. I hope this is fixed so I can centralize my programs I use to figma.",2,False,ADiddle2646,Major design flaw,us
2,2022-07-31 14:58:45,"I love Figma on desktop but the mobile app on phone and iPad fall short in a big way.  I use it almost exclusively for the mirror function and I would have given it 3 stars if it weren’t so buggy.  

Bugs I have found while using mirror include:
- Loses connection periodically 
- Freezes often and needs to be restarted 
- The prototype doesn’t always appear exactly as on screen.  For example, I had an icon with a transparent container around it and layers that had shadows.  It looked fine on the computer screen but on the phone, the container background appeared white and the shadows were applied to the container instead of the objects inside it. 
- It would be nice to have an option to turn on/off status bar and home bar if they are already on your designs.  
- Animations are not very smooth. 

Aside from the mirror feature, I wanted to view and respond to a comment while I was on the go, but I can’t see the comments.  

It seems all that I can do view my frames. I would really love editing capabilities, especially for iPad.  If I could design in Figma on iPad it would save my hand so much from all the mouse clicks.

3,2022-10-26 15:48:21,"I’m not entirely sure who the audience is for this. I use it as a way to keep track of designs and comments on Figma, but there are enough rough edges that I hesitate to open it.

1. Comment functionality was added (yes!), but you can’t find new comments within the file. You have to close the file, go to the alerts section and tap the comment there to then re-open the file to the new comment. Opening the file can take a minute, so this is really inefficient.

2. Within a. Few minutes of opening the file and zooming / scrolling around, the system seems to forget how to scroll and every swipe, two finger or one, activates the zoom. You have to force-quit the app to get it working again, and within a few minutes it’s back to zooming on every touch.

I think the team need to focus on why this app exists. I would love if it was for my use case—non-designer that needs to review mocks and make comments—but even if that wasn’t the goal, it needs some clear workflow definition.",3,False,Park's Pop,A bit flaky,us

This means if you have a pro account, and the invited person also has a pro account. You still get charged $15 the minute they can edit your file. This is not collaborative and makes me question the real “game changing” collaboration model they claim to offer. They’ve limited the free experience, which is fine.

Only problem was, I was given a day... 

Incredibly, I was able to get stuck into Figma so easily that I whipped up said MVP  within 3 hours, intuitively understood how to set up transitions and even got the team using Figma mirror to emulate the end result.

They all somehow knew what to do, could easily edit text and even left comment feedback.
